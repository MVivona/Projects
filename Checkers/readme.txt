Checkers Implementation

Setup:
	Save the model.py, view.py, and controller.py files to any particular directory and run the controller.py file from the command line or from a Python IDE after setting up a project for the files.

Rules:
	General rules of American checkers apply. (Note: computer opponent will not make multiple jumps)

Gameplay:
	The game uses a text-based interface with the human player entering piece coordinates with a keyboard. On the player's turn, select the row and column of the piece you would like to move separated by a comma (,) and no spaces. The format should look like this (5,0). Next, select the row and column of the space you would like to move your piece to separated by a comma (,) and no spaces. The format should look like this (4,1). Jumps are compulsory, and the program will prompt you to make a jump if you do not choose an available jump first. Similarly the program will prompt you if you make other errors in the game such as moving pieces vertically or horizontally or moving uncrowned pieces backwards.
